    "# Crew Ai Sandbox\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Crew AI?\n",
    "\n",
    "CrewAi is a framework to make it easier to work with roleplaying AI (LLM) agents to achieve a tree of thought. It is open source and its source code may be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts involved\n",
    "\n",
    "* LLM (Large Language Models)\n",
    "* Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend using `virtualenv`, once you have it create a new `virtualenv` on this folder, active it (by `source`ing on Unix systems the `activate` script) and restore dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also want to have `ollama` running locally in order to pull and use local LLMs. In order to save money this sandbox uses local environments instead of expensive OpenAI calls. Ollama can be found at [their official website](https://ollama.com/download).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier to interact with ollama without doing manual steps in the terminal or gui we'll be using `ollama-python` to set things up using the notebook itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems with Python 3.13\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Python 3.13 you might run into issues (as of 2024-12-14) when installing CrewAi thru pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get my environment to work I had to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up my machine to run `rust` by using the script from [RustUp.rs](https://rustup.rs)\n",
    "2. Add rust's cargo tools to my path by sourcing it on `.zshrc`\n",
    "3. Exporting a specific variable in order to toggle compatibility between 3.12 and 3.13 when compiling: `export PYO3_USE_ABI3_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY=1`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimenting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing the required libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted previously it's important to have a local copy of the requirements denoted in `requirements.txt`, if running only the notebook this setup phase may be achieved by running the cell below which will install the required dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend still using at the very least a `venv` for this notebook not to mess up any system-wide dependencies you might have in your own environment."

      "\t+ Primary Color: Red (#FFC080)\n",
      "\t+ Secondary Color: White (#FFFFFF)\n",
      "* **Logo**: A simple, yet distinctive logo that incorporates my name \"Karoline\" and the phrase \"Kandy\". The logo will feature a stylized letter \"K\" made up of candy shapes (e.g., lollipops, gummies) in Red, surrounded by a circle with White background. This logo will be used on business cards, flyers, and social media profiles.\n",
      "* **Social Media**: To reach my target audience (middle class and tourists), I would like to have a presence on the following social media platforms:\n",
      "\t+ Facebook: A profile page featuring updates about new products, promotions, and events at Karoline's Kandy. I will post high-quality images of our candies, cakes, and coffee, as well as behind-the-scenes content.\n",
      "\t+ Instagram: An account focused on showcasing visually appealing images and videos of our products, with captions highlighting the quality and uniqueness of each item. I will also use Instagram Stories to share sneak peeks, promotions, and exclusive deals.\n",
      "* **Digital Experiences**: To provide a seamless online experience for my customers, I would like to offer:\n",
      "\t+ Online Ordering: A simple, user-friendly ordering system that allows customers to purchase our products online and pick them up at the store or have them shipped to their doorstep (once logistics are sorted out).\n",
      "\t+ Email Newsletter: A monthly newsletter featuring exclusive promotions, new product releases, and special events at Karoline's Kandy.\n",
      "* **Tone**: The tone of my brand's communication will be friendly, approachable, and inviting. I want customers to feel welcome and valued when interacting with our business.\n",

      "**Budget Considerations**\n",
      "\n",
