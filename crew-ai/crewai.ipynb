    "# Crew Ai Sandbox\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Crew AI?\n",
    "\n",
    "CrewAi is a framework to make it easier to work with roleplaying AI (LLM) agents to achieve a tree of thought. It is open source and its source code may be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts involved\n",
    "\n",
    "* LLM (Large Language Models)\n",
    "* Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend using `virtualenv`, once you have it create a new `virtualenv` on this folder, active it (by `source`ing on Unix systems the `activate` script) and restore dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also want to have `ollama` running locally in order to pull and use local LLMs. In order to save money this sandbox uses local environments instead of expensive OpenAI calls. Ollama can be found at [their official website](https://ollama.com/download).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier to interact with ollama without doing manual steps in the terminal or gui we'll be using `ollama-python` to set things up using the notebook itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems with Python 3.13\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Python 3.13 you might run into issues (as of 2024-12-14) when installing CrewAi thru pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get my environment to work I had to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up my machine to run `rust` by using the script from [RustUp.rs](https://rustup.rs)\n",
    "2. Add rust's cargo tools to my path by sourcing it on `.zshrc`\n",
    "3. Exporting a specific variable in order to toggle compatibility between 3.12 and 3.13 when compiling: `export PYO3_USE_ABI3_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY=1`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimenting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing the required libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted previously it's important to have a local copy of the requirements denoted in `requirements.txt`, if running only the notebook this setup phase may be achieved by running the cell below which will install the required dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend still using at the very least a `venv` for this notebook not to mess up any system-wide dependencies you might have in your own environment."

      "\n",
      "### 1. System Architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Frontend**: Vue.js with TypeScript will be used to build the online store, email newsletter, and social media integrations.\n",
      "* **Backend**: .NET 6 with C# will power the online store's e-commerce functionality, integrating with Azure for cloud services and scalable infrastructure.\n",
      "* **Database**: A Microsoft SQL Server database on Azure will manage product information, orders, and customer data.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. System Components\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Online Store**:\n",
      "\t+ Catalog: Display products with images, descriptions, and prices.\n",
      "\t+ Cart: Allow customers to add/remove items and view subtotal/total.\n",
      "\t+ Checkout: Secure payment processing with credit cards and PayPal.\n",
      "\t+ Order Management: Track orders, manage inventory, and send order confirmations.\n",

      "* The online store will communicate with the backend to manage orders, inventory, and customer data.\n",
      "* The email newsletter system will integrate with the online store's subscription management feature.\n",
      "* Social media platforms (Facebook and Instagram) will be integrated for posting updates, sharing products, and engaging with customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Security and Scalability\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Security**:\n",
      "\t+ Implement HTTPS encryption for all interactions.\n",
      "\t+ Use secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for customer accounts.\n",
      "\t+ Regularly update dependencies and libraries to maintain security patches.\n",
      "* **Scalability**:\n",
      "\t+ Deploy the system on Azure, leveraging scalable infrastructure and load balancing.\n",
      "\t+ Monitor performance metrics to identify bottlenecks and optimize as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Budget Allocation\n",
      "\n",

      "* **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Allocate 10% for testing and quality assurance to ensure a stable and reliable system.\n",
      "* **Project Management**: Allocate 5% for project management, including stakeholder engagement and communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. Implementation Plan\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Development**: Develop the system in an iterative approach, focusing on core features first (online store, email newsletter).\n",
      "* **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Conduct thorough testing and quality assurance to ensure a stable and reliable system.\n",
      "* **Deployment**: Deploy the system on Azure, configuring load balancing and monitoring performance metrics.\n",
      "* **Maintenance and Support**: Provide ongoing maintenance and support to ensure the system remains stable and secure.\n",
