    "# Crew Ai Sandbox\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Crew AI?\n",
    "\n",
    "CrewAi is a framework to make it easier to work with roleplaying AI (LLM) agents to achieve a tree of thought. It is open source and its source code may be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts involved\n",
    "\n",
    "* LLM (Large Language Models)\n",
    "* Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend using `virtualenv`, once you have it create a new `virtualenv` on this folder, active it (by `source`ing on Unix systems the `activate` script) and restore dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also want to have `ollama` running locally in order to pull and use local LLMs. In order to save money this sandbox uses local environments instead of expensive OpenAI calls. Ollama can be found at [their official website](https://ollama.com/download).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier to interact with ollama without doing manual steps in the terminal or gui we'll be using `ollama-python` to set things up using the notebook itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems with Python 3.13\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Python 3.13 you might run into issues (as of 2024-12-14) when installing CrewAi thru pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get my environment to work I had to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up my machine to run `rust` by using the script from [RustUp.rs](https://rustup.rs)\n",
    "2. Add rust's cargo tools to my path by sourcing it on `.zshrc`\n",
    "3. Exporting a specific variable in order to toggle compatibility between 3.12 and 3.13 when compiling: `export PYO3_USE_ABI3_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY=1`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimenting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing the required libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted previously it's important to have a local copy of the requirements denoted in `requirements.txt`, if running only the notebook this setup phase may be achieved by running the cell below which will install the required dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend still using at the very least a `venv` for this notebook not to mess up any system-wide dependencies you might have in your own environment."
