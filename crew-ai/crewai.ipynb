    "# Crew Ai Sandbox\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Crew AI?\n",
    "\n",
    "CrewAi is a framework to make it easier to work with roleplaying AI (LLM) agents to achieve a tree of thought. It is open source and its source code may be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts involved\n",
    "\n",
    "* LLM (Large Language Models)\n",
    "* Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend using `virtualenv`, once you have it create a new `virtualenv` on this folder, active it (by `source`ing on Unix systems the `activate` script) and restore dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also want to have `ollama` running locally in order to pull and use local LLMs. In order to save money this sandbox uses local environments instead of expensive OpenAI calls. Ollama can be found at [their official website](https://ollama.com/download).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier to interact with ollama without doing manual steps in the terminal or gui we'll be using `ollama-python` to set things up using the notebook itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems with Python 3.13\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Python 3.13 you might run into issues (as of 2024-12-14) when installing CrewAi thru pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get my environment to work I had to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up my machine to run `rust` by using the script from [RustUp.rs](https://rustup.rs)\n",
    "2. Add rust's cargo tools to my path by sourcing it on `.zshrc`\n",
    "3. Exporting a specific variable in order to toggle compatibility between 3.12 and 3.13 when compiling: `export PYO3_USE_ABI3_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY=1`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimenting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing the required libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted previously it's important to have a local copy of the requirements denoted in `requirements.txt`, if running only the notebook this setup phase may be achieved by running the cell below which will install the required dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend still using at the very least a `venv` for this notebook not to mess up any system-wide dependencies you might have in your own environment."

    "### Using a Manager (hierarchical process)\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving on from the basics let's check out the Hierarchical process that's available out-of-the-box for CrewAi. This process mode aims to simulate traditional collaboration by adding in a \"manager\" and hierarchies between the agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Per the official docs:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The hierarchical process in CrewAI introduces a structured approach to task management, simulating traditional organizational hierarchies for efficient task delegation and execution. This systematic workflow enhances project outcomes by ensuring tasks are handled with optimal efficiency and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move into this let's redefine our experiment's scope and convert our configuration into files so we may test out the API that's primary recommended by CrewAI Docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The CrewAI Yaml files\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the concepts we have used so far as parameters on `Python` code are also loadable from files using the YAML syntax, this allows for decoupling of code-logic from agent-specific logic and would, in theory, allow you to easily modify prompts and Tasks on a deployed system by simply changing the YAML files instead of deploying a new code change.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our new experiment let's think about a team that works together to keep a social media account going. They should be aware of their handle (the @ username), a topic for a post and a set of tags that might be relevant to their audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The files themselves are on the [config](./config/) directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loading the files into the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "CrewAi.project provides us with annotations to allow reading from its `yaml` files and creating objects based on their attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base of this is the `@CrewBase` annotation that must be applied to a class, this annotation allows us to load the configs into class attributes and further use the other annotations (`@agent`, `@task`, `@crew`) to create functions that allow the Crew to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "One cool thing on this approach is the usage o `{placeholders}` within the yaml file to allow for one to provide different inputs to the same crew without having to recreate the Tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "One hack I had to do, in order for this to work on the notebook, was to create an empty `__init__.py` file and to extract the Crew logic itself into the `crew.py` file due to same weird dependencies getting mixed up by the Jupyter kernel."
